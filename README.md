This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model capable of accurately classifying textual data 
into predefined emotional categories using a supervised machine learning approach. Leveraging a 
dataset comprising over 50,000 labeled statements, this model will focus on distinguishing various 
sentiment classes, with an emphasis on detecting nuances associated with mental health expressions 
such as anxiety. Initially, data preprocessing will address missing values and prepare the text data 
through techniques including tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization, enhancing the 
relevance of input features. The preprocessed data will then be split into training and testing sets, with 
the training set used to develop and fine-tune machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, 
Support Vector Machines, and neural networks, to identify optimal performance. Hyperparameter 
tuning will further enhance model accuracy and generalizability. Following the training phase, the 
model's predictive capabilities will be evaluated on the test data using metrics such as accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure a robust understanding of its performance in real-world 
applications. This sentiment analysis project is expected to have broad applications, including mental 
health monitoring, personalized recommendations, and social media sentiment tracking, contributing to 
the broader field of affective computin
